Brief Finite Element .NET
-------------------------

Brief Finite Element .NET (or BFE.NET or BFE) is an object oriented framework that enables .NET developers to do some Finite Element Analysis using .NET objects.

If you like to learn by writing code, we'd recommend one of our :doc:`docs*/index` guides to get you started with BFE.NET.
