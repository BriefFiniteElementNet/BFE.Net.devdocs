Coordination Systems
--------------------

Local Coordination System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Local coordination system for ``TriangleElement`` has tree axis that we name ``x'``, ``y'`` and ``z'``.

Relation of global and local system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Imagine a triangle element with three nodes ``N1`` located at ``(x1, y1, z1)``, ``N2`` located at ``(x2,y2,z2)`` and ``N3`` located at ``(x3,y3,z3)``. Four steps are needed to find the directions of the local axis x'-y'-z':
