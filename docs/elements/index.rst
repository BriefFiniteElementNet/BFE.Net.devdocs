There are two types of elements available in BFE:
	- Normal Finite Elements: Physical elements that provide stiffness, mass and damp matrices.
	- Special Elements: Some kind of virtual elements that usually act as a rigid (infinite stiffness) connection (a connection that strictly binds two or more DoF together)
